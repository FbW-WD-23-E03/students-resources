# students-resources

in this repo:

- you can share your resources, notes, tips and tricks with your classmates! :smiley:	

- you are a collaborator! you can pull AND push as you want! :smiley:

### Best practice:
 the easiest way to use this repo is by creating a new folder with your name inside each module folder, and then add your README.md file there, this way we can all work on the main branch and avoid conflicts at the same time. Of course you can also make your own branch and add your notes there if you like to practice (merging your branch into main may cause some conflicts that need to be resolved first)
